# Introduction

My project for questions on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com). Solutions for questions are under `solutions/` folder. Each solution class contains TestCase. Solutions can be quickly evaluated by a single click.

# Folder Strucure

- Project Root
    - solutions/
        - BaseSolution.py : base class for all questions, with method to evaluate subclasses
        - TwoSum.py:        solution class for question "Two Sum" in leet code
        - SortList.py:      solution class for question "SortList" in leet code
        - ...
    - main.py :             entrance and invoker

# Run

In `main.py` change the solution class to the one to be evaluated with, and run.
